# moncard-lookup
A basic Python script that searches up Pokemon Cards. It could also work... literally most things.

## How to Run

To run, clone this repository into any directory.

> git clone https://github.com/lud-code/moncard-lookup.git .

Then, type this command into your terminal:

> python main.py

## Purpouse

There really isn't much purpouse to this. You could easily go to an online website and search up prices.

However, if you would like a decent CLI, use this! If you're using this for tinkering purpouses, thanks, and please contribute! (Trust me, my code is trash.)
